Lab 5 Remote Sensing
In this lab, I decided to research more about Infrastructure asset management and monitoring because I feel that it is important to monitor different types of infrastructure. This is important because damage can happen to different types of infrastructure which can lead to many bad situations with people who use these infrastructures. In my first article “Deformation Monitoring of Post-Tensioned Bridges Using High-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing,” the authors talk about how routine safety inspections have revealed cracks in two bridges in Virginia. They used TerraSAR-X radar satellite imagery for 1.3 years to determine if there were any deformations. The authors mentioned that since 2017 over 54,000 bridges are in poor condition in the United States with only 9 percent of these bridges in service. As stated earlier, the authors decided to use SAR in remote sensing because it allows high-resolution ground surveillance. The advantage of using SAR for this project was because it uses active microwave frequency signals and these signals are not obstructed by cloud cover and ambient lighting. They can be used in all weather conditions. The results that the authors got from this imagery were that there were no permanent deformations detected over the period of time they conducted this analysis. 
While there are many ways to fix infrastructure and asset management, there are challenges every day due to the economy and politics. In the article “Challenges in infrastructure assets management,” the authors state that the costs of using new technologies to fix infrastructure are too expensive. The authors mention that using research within universities can provide innovative solutions to reduce lifestyle costs. Some factors that researchers have started to implement are electronic sources like LIDAR data, phones, and embedded sources. Researchers feel like they can understand these problems with better performance and understand the risks a lot better. 
I mentioned earlier that researchers are using LIDAR data to monitor infrastructure asset networks. In the article “Simulation of airborne LiDAR for the assessment of its role in infrastructure asset monitoring,” the authors state that LIDAR is being used to monitor flood defence embankments but there are problems due to limitations in acquiring suitable datasets. Some of the results that the authors encountered were importing a LIDAR ASCII file into ArcGIS Packager. The simulation ended up with a 1.0 grid solution with a failure of 5x6 m with a failure of 1.0 m. The authors stated, “The results of this type of exercise could then be used to determine the optimal LiDAR survey for a flood defence system for asset monitoring purposes.”(Long, 5) Hopefully, full data sets of LIDAR can come to fruition in the near future.
